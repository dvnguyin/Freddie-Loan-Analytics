# Freddie Mac Loan Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes Freddie Mac mortgage origination data to explore
credit quality, loan-to-value (CLTV) risk, and geographic loan concentration.
The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end analytics workflow:
ETL → aggregation → visualization → insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas)
- Power BI
- CSV / Parquet data formats

## Key Analyses
- Loan volume by credit score band
- Loan volume by CLTV band
- Top U.S. states by loan count

## Key Insights
- Most loans fall in the 740+ credit score band, indicating strong borrower quality.
- Lower CLTV bands (<80) dominate loan volume, suggesting conservative lending.
- Texas, Florida, and California have the highest loan concentration.
